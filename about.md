<b>ਮੇਰਾ ਮਨੁ ਲੋਚੈ ਗੁਰ ਦਰਸਨ ਤਾਈ ॥ ਬਿਲਪ ਕਰੇ ਚਾਤ੍ਰਿਕ ਕੀ ਨਿਆਈ ॥ ਤ੍ਰਿਖਾ ਨ ਉਤਰੈ ਸਾਂਤਿ ਨ ਆਵੈ ਬਿਨੁ ਦਰਸਨ ਸੰਤ ਪਿਆਰੇ ਜੀਉ ॥੧॥ </b>

Hi there, my name is Irvanjit. I'm an engineering student, bookworm, geek, and spiritual seeker.

I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca/engineering).

The inner geek: I like hacking on Python and Android projects on occasion. [Check out my GitHub](https://github.com/irvanjit).

When I'm not at school or coding away, I enjoy listening to classical music (I'm learning something called [Gurmat Sangeet](http://www.rajacademy.com/history-of-gurmat-sangeet)), working out and meditating.

I have an old [Wordpress blog](http://irvanjit.wordpress.com) that almost makes me cringe.

Sometimes I rant about politics, society and various community issues (which deserves a blog of its own).
